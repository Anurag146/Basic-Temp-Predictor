Basic Temperature Prediction 

Project Overview
This repository contains my first Data Science project completed during a 2-month internship. I explored the relationship between humidity and temperature using Linear Regression.

Key Learnings

Simple Linear Regression:

- Goal: Predict temperature using only Humidity.
- Data: Hourly readings from sensors.
- Results: R-squared of 0.26.

Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression, Train-Test Split)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data Visualization)

How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`

Dataset: The dataset used for this project is too large to be hosted directly on GitHub.
